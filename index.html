      <h1 class="w3-center">About DONUT</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1847</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">A doughnut or donut is a type of leavened fried dough.It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. 'Doughnut' is the traditional spelling, whilst 'donut' is the simplified version. Both terms are often used interchangeably in the English-language.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or a number of shapes without a hole, and often filled, but can also be ball-shaped ("doughnut holes"). Other types of batters can also be used, and various toppings and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.</p>

      <h4>Rings</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Ring doughnuts are formed by one of two methods: by joining the ends of a long, skinny piece of dough into a ring, or by using a doughnut cutter, which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape, leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole (from the dough removed from the center). </p><br>
    
      <h4>Topping</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">After frying, ring doughnuts are often topped. Raised doughnuts are generally covered with a glaze (icing). </p><br>
    
      <h4>Holes</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Doughnut holes are small, bite-sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Filled</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Filled doughnuts are flattened spheres injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings, and often dipped into powdered sugar or topped off with frosting.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Other shapes</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Others include the fritter and the Dutchie, which are usually glazed. These have been available on Tim Hortons' doughnut menu since the chain's inception in 1964, and a 1991 Toronto Star report found these two were the chain's most popular type of fried dough in Canada.</p>
